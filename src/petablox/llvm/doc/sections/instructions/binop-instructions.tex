\subsection{Binary Operation Instructions} 
The binary operations are: \texttt{add, fadd, sub, fsub, mul, fmul, udiv, sdiv, fdiv, urem, srem} and \texttt{frem}.
The bitwise binary operations are: \texttt{shl, lshr, ashr, and, or} and \texttt{xor}.
For an instruction, \texttt{name} from these operations, the relation is:\\

\noindent Instruction ID:
\texttt{name\_instruction(id).}

\noindent First operand:
\texttt{name\_instruction\_first\_operand(id, left).}

\noindent Second operand:
\texttt{name\_instruction\_second\_operand(id, right).}
